                        Objective: Create a playable game that allows the player to control the direction of gravity in order to allow a character to travel through unique game levels to an end destination.
        
                       <p>• Worked with the Unity Physics Engine in order to adjust the player character's velocity, acceleration, and collisions with other game objects.</p> 
        
                        <p>• Designed unique game levels by using Scenes, Tile maps, and game objects in order to make each level have a different layout and implement new variables into the game.</p>
        
                        <p>• Coded Scripts for each game object to ensure that all moving parts worked harmoniously and that the game was able to function correctly.</p>
        
                        <p>• Implemented Animations into different obstacles that were placed throughout each level.</p>
