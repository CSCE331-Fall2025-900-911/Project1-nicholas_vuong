                    Frontend, UI Design, Website Design, AI, Machine Learning, 3D/2D Modeling, Game Design, etc. The reason I like most of these genres
                    within computer science is because it allows me to showcase creative ability and having the ability to actually see my work and showcase it to users.

            <p>Newmark Internship</p>
        </div>
            <ul>
                My time at Newmark was nothing short of a wonderful experience. I was able to experience living in New York City after my first year of college,
                which gave new exciting experiences while also along stressful ones. Newmark gave me a taste of how software was really
                applied in real world situations, and how the intersection of business and technology is crucial for how companies operate. Being able to work with 
                different departments, participate in on site tours, and give elaborate presenations to real business projects really opened up my perspective of how
                technical skills could be valued beyond just a screen. However, the projects that I did end up working on did also broaden my technical skills, and allow me 
                to learn valuable skills. As the youngest Software Engineering Intern with Newmark, I discovered a new side to the application of software and the use of AI.
